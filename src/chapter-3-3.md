Sentiment analysis is a machine learning technique that analyzes text data (including social media posts, customer reviews, and surveys) to identify the emotional tone of that text. Sentiment analysis algorithms use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify words and phrases that indicate positive or negative sentiment.
